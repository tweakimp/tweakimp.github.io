    The nowcast of the output gap is based on the method described in
    <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3586374">Berger, Morley, and Wong (2020)</a>.
    Please cite the paper when referring to the nowcast estimate.
    The nowcast for the current quarter in which real GDP has not yet been released is reported
    in the figure using a dashed line from the actual estimated output gap for previous quarters.
    The actual estimated output gap is based on parameter estimates using data from 1967-2019
    for the mixed-frequency Bayesian VAR specified in
    <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3586374">Berger, Morley, and Wong (2020)</a>
    and
    data up to the latest quarter for which real GDP has been released from
    <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/">FRED</a>.
    The monthly
    variables that feed into the nowcast are specified in the table in bold. The remaining monthly
    variables for the current quarter are based on conditional forecasts from the mixed-frequency
    model.
    The forecast for the next quarter is reported in the figure using a dotted line from the nowcast
    for the current quarter. The slider below the figure determines the nature of a scenario
    forecast. If it is set to 0, the conditional forecast is reported. If severity factor is set to 1, the
    values of labor-market variables in bold-italics are set based on the average trajectory x-
    months after a recession and assuming the COVID-19 recession began in March 2020. An
    increase in the severity factor worsens the values of labor-market variables x-months after a
    recession by that factor. All other variables in the table not yet realized or directly set (not in
    bold or bold-italics) are recalculated based on the conditional expectation from the model and
    the set values in bold-italics.
